Interactive figure, nifti templates and code for reproduceability of Thompson &amp; Fransson (2017)

__It's current in press, link to study when published__

__This repository is under construction, this line will be removed when it is complete. Still to be done: reprodeability section__

## Structure of repository

The structure of the repository is as follows:

```

./interactive_figure
./reproduceability
    ./as_is
    ./clean
./templates

```

## Interactive figure

The interactive figure (showing 1b with roll over) is a .html file. It does not seem possible for github to display it as it is and needs to be downloaded and opened in the browser. I will try and embed this to be viewed online at some point.

## Reproduceability

Contains code to remake the analysis. See readme in `./reproduceability` for information about `./as_is` and `./clean`

## Templates

Contains the nifti templates that are derived in the article. The files are described in the article. The compressed file ending with `_selected` are the ones contained to be possibly interesting. This was however a subjective decision. The compressed file ending with `_all` contains all templates.
